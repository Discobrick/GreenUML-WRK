==========================================================================================

Green is a LIVE round-tripping editor, meaning that it supports both software engineering and reverse engineering. 
You can use green to create a UML class diagram from code, or to generate code by drawing a class diagram.

Green was developed with the pedagogical goal of focusing students on design. 
However green has proven to be a robust and flexible tool that can easily provide UML support in any environment.
The editor features a simple point-and-click interface. Right-clicking in the editor brings up a 
context-sensitive menu that includes features such as the refactoring and quick-fix functionality.

Green supports exporting files to jpg, png and gif format, so that you can share you diagrams without any issues.
