  If the project contains existing class files, they will be automatically loaded<br>

  Diagrams can also be opened from the package and class file levels. They will 
  include the appropriate classes if they exist and will be placed according to 
  the "Create all diagram files in project root" option in <a href="pref_general.html">Preferences</a>.
