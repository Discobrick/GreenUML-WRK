<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>When I try to open a new diagram, Eclipse tells me 
  that "The chosen operation is not currently available." What do I do?</strong>
  <br>
  In order for Green to run properly, it is necessary that you have Java 8 installed 
  and that Java 8 is used to load the Green plugin. <br>
  </p>

<p><strong>How do I save my diagram as a GIF/JPEG/other image file?</strong><br>
  In the 'Save As...' menu, you can choose on of four saving options: Green 
  File, GIF, JPEG & PNG. In order to save in a particular formAat, you should append the appropriate extension to the filename. <br>
  Please Note: In order for the Green 'Save As...' menu option to be available, 
  the Green editor window needs to be open. <br>
  </p>
<p><strong>I have a suggestion 
  for improving Green/I still can't get it to work/Something doesn't seem to be 
  right... </strong> <br>
Unfortunately, the team that originally developed this plug-in 
is no longer working on it and probably attempts to contact them will be unsuccessful.
However, you can report your issues <a href="https://github.com/ValdisVitolins/GreenUML/issues"> here.</a> <br>
Pleaso note that we do not plan on any improvements or updates for now.
